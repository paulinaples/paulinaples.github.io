  <p>Hi, my name is Paulina Gomez. I’m 24 years old and from Naples, Florida, with roots in Colombia. I’m currently a graduate student studying communications and work as a video content creator. In my free time, I love making videos, watching boxing and MMA, and spending time with friends. My passion for storytelling and media drives both my work and personal projects, and I’m always looking for creative ways to connect with others through content.



.</p>

  <p> I’ve always been passionate about content creation, and I currently work as a video content creator for a luxury watch retailer. I’m also building my own freelance business, PGC Productions, where I create videos for local businesses and events like weddings and sports. I love blending creativity with strategy, and I’m especially interested in how media impacts communities—particularly when it comes to access, inclusion, and digital literacy.</p>
